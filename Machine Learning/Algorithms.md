# Algorithms

## Supervised Learning
The data set contains input and corresponding correct output, and the goal of the model is to learn the mapping relationship from it so as to be able to predict new unlabeled data. Common supervised learning tasks include *classification* and *regression*.
### Linear Regression

### Logistic Regression

### SVM, Support Vector Machine

### KNN, K-Nearest Neighbors

### Decision Tree

### Random Forest

### GBM, Gradient Boosting Machine

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning does not depend on labeled data, and the model directly discovers the internal structure from the input data. Common tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.

### 1. Clustering

### K-Means

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

### PCA, Principal Component Analysis
